# Roadmap

This document describes the **direction of the namel3ss language**, not a delivery schedule.
Items are intentionally high-level and evolve as the system matures.

## Stronger schema validation
Richer, more expressive record schemas with explicit constraints and defaults, while preserving deterministic behavior and clear failure modes.

## Safer outbound integrations
Carefully governed HTTP and external interactions with strict, deterministic contracts and explicit capability boundaries.

## Richer declarative UI
An expanded set of declarative UI components for clearer empty states, progress, and status representation—fully inspectable and source-ordered.

## Deterministic scheduling and retries
More expressive job scheduling and retry semantics based on logical time, without reliance on wall clocks or hidden behavior.

## Deeper explainability and auditability
Improved traces, summaries, and exportable explanations that make application behavior easier to reason about and verify.

## Capability pack ecosystem
A small, curated ecosystem of signed capability packs for common integrations, designed to remain explicit, inspectable, and deterministic.

## Developer experience refinement
Ongoing polish across the CLI, error messages, documentation, and Studio to keep the language predictable, approachable, and precise.

### Roadmap principles
- No dates or version promises  
- No speculative features  
- Determinism and explicitness come first
