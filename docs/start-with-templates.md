# Start with Templates

## What templates are
Templates are canonical production primitives. They are deterministic, explainable, and safe by default. They are not demos.

## Choose a template
- knowledge: retrieval workflows with cited answers and explainable updates.
- operations: job lifecycle visibility with replayable narratives and audit surfaces.
- support: case lifecycle handling with deterministic routing and escalation.

## Discover templates
- Run `n3 new` to list available templates.
- See the template contract in [templates/README.md](../templates/README.md).
- See the template index in [templates/index.md](../templates/index.md).

## Stability
- [README.md#stability-guarantees](../README.md#stability-guarantees)
