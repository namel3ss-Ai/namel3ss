# Start with Templates

## What templates are
Templates are canonical production primitives. They are deterministic, explainable, and safe by default.

## Choose a template
The canonical templates are listed in a stable order:
- knowledge: retrieval-first systems with cited answers and explainable updates.
- support: case lifecycle handling with deterministic routing and escalation.
- operations: job lifecycle visibility with replayable narratives and audit surfaces.

## First commands
- n3 new
- n3 new <template> <name>
