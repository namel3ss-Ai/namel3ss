# Demo: CRUD Dashboard

## What it shows
- Records with validation (Customer)
- Deterministic seed flow and state reset
- Forms and tables wired to actions
- Simple layout with section/card/row/column

## Try it in 60 seconds
```bash
n3 examples/demo_crud_dashboard.ai check
n3 examples/demo_crud_dashboard.ai ui
n3 examples/demo_crud_dashboard.ai studio
```

## Key concepts
- Record validation (`present`, `pattern`, `gt`)
- `save` via form, actions for seed/reset
- UI structure: section, row/column, card, form, table
- Theme-ready UI (uses default theme)

## Explore in Studio
- Run “Seed demo data” then view table rows
- Submit the form with invalid email to see validation
- Reset state (records remain) to observe state panel
- Inspect actions and traces after each button click
