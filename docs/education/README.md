# Education Program

This folder defines the official learning path for namel3ss.
All materials are versioned and deterministic.

## Files
- `catalog.yaml`: course list and module ordering.
- `certifications.yaml`: certification tracks and exam rules.
- `events.yaml`: recurring workshops and community sessions.

## Principles
- Keep lessons short and practical.
- Use plain language and runnable examples.
- Pin course content to language-spec versions.
- Keep scoring and completion rules deterministic.

## How to contribute
- Propose updates through pull requests.
- For language-semantic changes, include an RFC reference.
- Keep one concept per lesson module.
- Update tests when adding or changing catalog entries.
