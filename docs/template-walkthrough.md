# Template Walkthrough

## Template
Knowledge is a canonical template for retrieval-first systems.

## Lifecycle
- Ingest: normalize inputs and apply deterministic quality gates.
- Retrieve: select sources in a stable order.
- Answer: return cited responses or a clear no-answer outcome.
- Explain: surface why each source and decision was chosen.
- Update: apply incremental changes with auditable lineage.
