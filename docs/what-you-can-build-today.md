# What you can build today

## Build today
- CRUD dashboards
  - Records with validation, forms, tables, and seed/refresh flows in one `.ai` file.
- Internal admin tools
  - Deterministic flows, predictable actions, and inspectable state for operations teams.
- AI assistants over records
  - Ask AI profiles with memory and traces; mock provider works out of the box, real providers with env keys.
- Multi-step onboarding flows
  - Sections, cards, rows/columns, forms with constraints, and confirmation sections wired to state.

## Best for
- Builders who want a single file to describe data, UI, flows, and AI.
- Teams validating ideas quickly with deterministic, inspectable behavior.
- Developers who prefer explicit grammar over hidden magic.

## Not yet
- Advanced styling or arbitrary CSS theming.
- Complex navigation/routing beyond current pages.
- Native mobile packaging.
- Production-grade authentication/roles.
- Provider-side tool-calling for cloud LLMs (mock only today).
