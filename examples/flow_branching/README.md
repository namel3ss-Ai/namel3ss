# flow_branching

This example shows run outcome summaries with `n3 what`.

Run:
- `cd examples/flow_branching && n3 run app.ai`
- `cd examples/flow_branching && n3 with`
- `cd examples/flow_branching && n3 what`

What to look for:
- Outcome status (ok/partial/error).
- Store/state/memory flags.
- What did not happen entries when a persistence step is skipped or fails.
