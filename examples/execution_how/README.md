# execution how example

This example shows explainable execution for if/else, repeat, and match.

## Run
```bash
n3 run app.ai
n3 how
```

## What to look for
- The if/else branch taken and the skipped branch.
- The repeat body skipped (count is 0).
- The match case taken and the otherwise branch skipped.
